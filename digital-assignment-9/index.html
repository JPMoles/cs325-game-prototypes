<h2>Chicken Farm</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
    My game is about farming as many plants as you can before time runs out. You have 5 rounds to get as many points as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
    The plant system was the most interesting part of this game. To have it interact with both the player and chickens was a difficult task.
    Each plant grows from a different seed, and they each give varying points when collected. Also, having all growth and player movement stop
    when the chickens start cross was unique.
