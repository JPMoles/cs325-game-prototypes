<h2>Playful Potions</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
Experience the various effects of different potions!
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
It's the basic platformer in which you collect an item (the potions) to increase your score, and enemies spawn in that make movement more difficult.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype? I learned about sprites, images, player movement, and lots of the basics of phaser.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it? Figuring out whats wrong when nothing works.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li>Background: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/sky-background">Sky</a></li>
<li>Potions: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/procedural-potion-icons">Potions (Red & Green)</a></li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
https://phaser.io/examples/v3/category/games/firstgame - I followed the tutorial for creating a your first game and expanded on it to help add new challenges.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Jump to the skies to collect the falling potions and beat your high-score!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the chemist theme.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I used direct input with the keyboard. It has a little bit of randomness with the potion and bomb spawning. The playstyle is Competitor as one seeks to achieve a higher score on each run of the game. The genre is platformer.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating? This game is evaluating how basic jumping works with gravity and collisions with gameobjects help provide an interactive game.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game? I want my players to feel enjoyment when beating their high-scores and be distraight when they inevitably hit a bomb.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can jump by pressing the "up" button on their keyboard. They can move left with the "left" arrow key and "right" with the right arrow key. The player gains 10 points when collecting the green potions, and loses 12 points when collecting the red potions. When all the green potions have been collect more will spawn. This is the same with the red potions. When all the green potions have been collect a bomb will also spawn. Upon collision with the bomb the game ends the final score is shown in the top left.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I expect the player will try to find jumping patterns to avoid the red potions and only collect the green potions. Also, watching for the bounce patterns of the bomb to avoid it at all cost.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?<br>
Jack is a purple alien. He's been dropped into a world full of wooden platforms. The skies rainning potions of different colors. The game is abstract. Jack feels a pang of reward when he collects the green potions, and a ding of loss when collecting the red potions.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
This game looks to reach out to new gamers who want to play a simple platformer.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
A few minutes.
</li>
