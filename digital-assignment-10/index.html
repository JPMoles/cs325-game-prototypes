<h2>Space Shooter</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
    <p>The movement is based around the mouse as opposed to the keyboard. Boosting is an interesting mechanic in space flight games, because normally you would boost forward, not to the left or right.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
    <p>The most interesting part is the ship movement or the background repeating and layers.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
    What did you learn from this prototype? <p>I learned a lot more about controlling physics bodies, and how</p>
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it? <p>The easiest part was adding lives and score. The hardest part was adjusting the boost and fixing the texture bleeding from the animations.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
    <p><a href="https://learn.yorkcs.com/2019/02/08/build-a-space-shooter-with-phaser-3-5/" target="_blank">Space Shooter</a> - This game is what I worked off of after going through the tutorial to make it. </p>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
    <p>A top-down 2D space shooter centere around eccentric mouse movement and ship boosts.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
    <p>I didn't follow any theme for the bonus game :)</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
    <p>This game has mouse and keyboard input. It utilizes randomness and has a action playstyle.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
    <p>Continuous mouse-based top-down movement. The goal was to have the play constantly trying to readjust their position, so they aren't able to keep following a simple pattern to defeat the ships.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
    <p>I want players to experience the feel of moving the ship in a more flowy way than even asteroids. The mouse makes adjusting the ship very difficult, but boosting in directions helps to make up for that when you get in a bad situation.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
    <p>Mouse - Ship movement<br>Double click "a" - boost left<br>Double click "d" - boost right<br>Space - shoot</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
    <p>I think they will utilize the boosts to get around the enemies shots. Staying towards the edges seems to make it more difficult to doge the ships.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
    <p>This game takes place in a classic space world in which everything is 2d and is in constant conflict. You are alone and must combat the onslaught of enemy ships flying toward you. As you the player continually kill the ships you feel accomplishment in your task as it is relfected in your score.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
    <p>This game is trying to reach people who enjoy playing classic 2D top-down space shooters.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
    <p>About 1 minute if you last that long</p>
</li>
