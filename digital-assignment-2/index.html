<h2>Save Oasis</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
The player must fling the oasis back to it's desert. I have not seen many games using the mouse as a mechanism for movement, so I tried to achieve something different with this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
The player must use their mouse to direct the oasis. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype? I learned about different kinds of input, and more about collision between bodies.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it? Figuring out whats wrong when nothing works.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Oasis: <a href="">Me</a></li>
<li>Background: <a href="https://wallpaperaccess.com/pixel-space">Space</a></li>
<li>Space Finish Zone: <a href="">Me</a></li>
<li>Pins: <a href="">Me</a></li>
<li>Wall: <a href="">Me</a></li>
<li>Cloud: <a href="https://latenighcoffe.itch.io/2d-pixel-art-semi-realistic-clouds">Cloud</a></li>
<li>Sand Finish Zone: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/8x8px-sand-cacti-scorpion-tileset">Sand</a></li>
<li>Pop Sound: me </li>
<li>Music: <a href="https://www.dl-sounds.com/royalty-free/blazer-rail-2/">Arcade</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/physics/arcade/move-to-pointer - I used this example for the initial oasis movement.
https://phaser.io/examples/v3/category/games/firstgame - Many things were drawn from my experience making the first example game.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Fling the oasis back to the desert before it's lost to space forever!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the oasis theme.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I used input with the mouse. The placement of all physics bodies is deterministic for each play of the game. The playstyle is Performer. The genre is overhead arcade.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating? This game is evaluating bouncing through mouse input. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game? I want my players to feel enjoyment in trying to direct the oasis in different ways to make it to the desert.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can direct the movement of the oasis by pressing the "left mouse" button. The player will bounce as it collides with the pins. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I expect the player will try direct the oasis along a simple path to bounce to the desert.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?<br>
The oasis is lost in space. It wants to get back to it's home in the cozy desert. Through other worldly forces the oasis is being flung about and hopes this force will be altruistic. If the oasis misses it's chance to bounce back to it's home it will be lost to space forever.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
I'm trying to reach players who love classic arcade games. This resembles pinball with a bit of a spin on the input. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
A little bit.
</li>
